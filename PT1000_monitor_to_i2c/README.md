# Multiple PT1000 to I2C
Monitoring of PT1000 on Sorel MTDC (also sold as OEM, so it may be found under a lot of other names as well).

For connecting S1, S2 and S3 PT1000 sensors, connect S1 to A0, S2 to A1 and S3 to A2 and Ground to ... ground :)

For external I2C connection, use GND, SDA (A4) and SCL (A5).
